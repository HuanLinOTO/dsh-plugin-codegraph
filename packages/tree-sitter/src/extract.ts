/**
 * Whether a declaration is exported from its module, by the export construct its own language
 * defines: ECMAScript wraps an exported statement in `export_statement`, or — for CommonJS code, still
 * common outside pure-ESM projects — is named by a top-level `module.exports`/`exports` assignment (see
 * {@link commonJsExportedNames}); Go's spec defines an exported identifier as one starting with an
 * uppercase letter, with no separate keyword; Java marks a declaration exported by an explicit
 * `public` modifier (see {@link javaHasModifier}) — an interface member's implicit `public` with no
 * keyword at all is not detected, matching this function's existing refusal to infer visibility from
 * anything but an explicit language construct; C's is external vs. internal *linkage* — a top-level
 * function or variable without `static` has external linkage (visible to other translation units), the
 * same real-rule precedent Go's capitalization check follows rather than a guess; C++ inherits that same
 * rule for its own free (non-member) functions and variables, but reports `false` for a class/struct
 * member — a method or field has no comparable linkage concept of its own, and neither does any other
 * kind (`struct`, `enum`, `type_alias`); C# marks a declaration exported by an explicit `public` modifier
 * (see {@link csharpHasModifier}), mirroring Java; Python defines no export construct at all, so every
 * Python declaration reports `false` rather than guess one from a naming convention or an `__all__` list
 * the extractor does not read; Rust marks a declaration exported by an explicit bare `pub`
 * `visibility_modifier` (see {@link rustIsPublic}) — a restricted `pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`/`pub(self)`
 * does not count, mirroring Java's/C#'s explicit-`public`-only convention.
 * @param node - the definition node.
 * @param language - the seam language label the file was parsed as.
 * @param name - the declaration's simple name.
 * @param commonJsExports - every name a CommonJS export assignment in this file binds.
 * @returns whether the language's own export rule marks this declaration exported.
