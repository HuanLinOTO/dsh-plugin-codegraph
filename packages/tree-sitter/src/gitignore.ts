/**
 * A deliberately small subset of `.gitignore` pattern syntax, just enough to keep the indexer's
 * exclusion set in step with what a project's own build tooling already hides from version control —
 * without a new dependency on a full gitignore-matching library.
 *
 * Only the project root's `.gitignore` is read; per-directory `.gitignore` files nested below it are
 * not consulted, matching the walk's own root-relative worldview.
 *
 * Supported:
 *  - Blank lines and lines starting with `#` are comments.
 *  - A leading `!` negates: a later matching rule re-includes a path an earlier rule excluded.
 *  - A pattern containing `/` (leading or internal) is anchored to the project root; one with no `/`
 *    at all matches at any depth, by basename.
 *  - A trailing `/` restricts the rule to directories.
 *  - `*` matches any run of characters other than `/`, within one path segment.
 *
 * Not supported. Each is treated as a literal character (or, for `**`, as two literal `*` globs),
 * which only ever makes a pattern *more* specific than a real gitignore would — it degrades toward
 * "excludes nothing extra" rather than toward "excludes too much":
 *  - `**` (explicit multi-segment wildcards — plain unanchored patterns already cross depths)
 *  - character classes (`[abc]`), `?`, and backslash escapes
 *  - git's rule that a negation cannot resurrect a path inside an already-excluded directory: here,
 *    a negation re-includes whatever it matches regardless of ancestor exclusions.
 * @module @huanlin/dsh-plugin-codegraph-tree-sitter/gitignore
