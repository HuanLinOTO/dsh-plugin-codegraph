/**
 * Git hooks as an opt-in alternative to live file watching: a caller who wants a reindex to follow
 * `git checkout`/`merge`/`commit`/`rebase` rather than (or in addition to) every individual file edit
 * can install a hook that runs one command after each.
 *
 * Deliberately just a library function, never wired into plugin load or exposed as a model-visible
 * tool: `.git/hooks/*` is shared, ambient state that outlives this plugin and can collide with a
 * user's other tooling (husky, lint-staged, ...) — installing it automatically, or letting a model
 * decide to install it, is a materially bigger blast radius than the `.codegraph/` cache this package
 * otherwise owns outright. A caller wires this in deliberately, from their own init script.
 *
 * Resolving *which* `hooksDir` to use — including the "worktrees share one hooks directory" case — is
 * the caller's job, composed from {@link detectWorktree} in `worktree.ts`; this module only ever
 * touches the one directory path it is given.
 * @module @huanlin/dsh-plugin-codegraph-tree-sitter/git-hooks
