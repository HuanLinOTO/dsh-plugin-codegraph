/**
 * File-watch-driven reindexing: debounce a workspace's file-change events into a bounded number of
 * `sync` calls, using a per-platform strategy chosen to keep the open-descriptor / kernel-watch cost
 * BOUNDED rather than growing with the number of files:
 *
 *  - macOS / Windows: a SINGLE recursive `fs.watch(root, {recursive:true})`. This is the fix for the
 *    macOS file-table exhaustion a reference implementation hit watching one file descriptor per
 *    watched file (tens of thousands of REG fds), which exhausted `kern.maxfiles` and crashed
 *    unrelated processes system-wide (see NOTES.local.md). One recursive stream costs O(1)
 *    descriptors no matter how large the tree.
 *  - Linux: recursive `fs.watch` is unsupported, so one inotify watch is installed per (non-excluded)
 *    directory — O(directories), NOT O(files). New directories are picked up dynamically as events
 *    reveal them, and {@link WatchConfig.maxWatchedDirectories} bounds inotify usage on pathological
 *    monorepos.
 *
 * `sync` is always a full rebuild in this version: the `paths` a debounce window collected are passed
 * through but never consulted by the caller supplied here (`runIndex` reruns `walkAndExtract` over the
 * whole tree regardless). That keeps this file's only new correctness surface confined to "when do we
 * call sync", not "what does sync do with a subset of files" — the latter is deliberately deferred
 * until a real incremental reindex is built (see NOTES.local.md). Because sync is always full, a
 * directory delete or a `mkdir` immediately followed by writes inside it never needs special-casing:
 * the parent directory's own create event is enough to schedule a rebuild that discovers (or removes)
 * everything under the path from scratch, watched or not.
