/**
 * Worktree diagnostics: is a given root a linked `git worktree`, and if so, where is the main
 * repository it was created from?
 *
 * This is a diagnostic, not a bug fix. The reference implementation's original incident here was
 * index resolution walking *up* from a linked worktree and finding the main repository's
 * `.codegraph/`, silently querying the wrong graph. This package has no such code path —
 * `databasePath()` is always `join(projectRoot, '.codegraph/codegraph.db')`, and `walkAndExtract`
 * never looks outside the `projectRoot` it was given. If a caller ever *does* end up pointed at the
 * wrong root, the bug is almost certainly in how the host resolves a session's working directory, not
 * in this package — this module exists to make that distinction diagnosable, not to route around it.
