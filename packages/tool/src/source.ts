/**
 * Source retrieval for the operations that return code. Reads go through `ctx.fs`, never
 * `node:fs`: the filesystem seam is what resolves a path against the session workspace, enforces
 * read policy, and reaches a remote sandbox, so a tool that opened files directly would bypass all
 * three for the one operation most likely to touch a file it should not.
 *
 * A read that fails is not an error here. The graph names a file the index recorded, which may since
 * have been renamed or deleted; the honest answer is the symbols with `code: null`, not a failed
 * query.
